<h1>impact - direct impact computation.</h1>
<p>
This program computes whether a direct impact between two white dwarfs
occurs and where it does so if it does. It reports X, Y and the radius scaled by 
the binary separation, as well as the L1 distance plus the separation in solar radii
and orbital period in seconds.
<p>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>m1</i></td><td>---</td><td>Mass of accretor, solar masses. Its radius will be computed using Eggleton's M-R relation.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>m2</i></td><td>---</td><td>Mass of donor, solar masses.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>period</i></td><td>---</td><td>Orbital period, seconds. If <= 0, it will be computed assuming that the secondary also 
follows Eggleton's M-R relation</td></tr>
</table>
