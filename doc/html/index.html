<h1>Roche, version 1.0.4</h1>
<p>
This is the main page for documentation on the C++-based roche routines.
Mostly these are callable functions, but there are a few programs as well.
The programs all use a convention of a binary of unit separation with an
X-axis pointing from star 1 to star 2 and a mass ratio defined as q = M2/M1.
The Y-axis points in the direction of motion of star 2, and the Z-axis completes
the 3 with the usual right-handed orientation.
