<h1>pcont - contours of Roche potential</h1>
<p>
Given a mass ratio, orbital inclination and filling factor this program
computes phases and vector multpliers within which, if the point is ever
eclipsed, the linje of sight from it dips below the stellar photosphere.
It then computes a grid between these values which it plots as a greyscale
and contours with a green contour for the critical Roche potential. It keeps
prompting for new points until you give up.
